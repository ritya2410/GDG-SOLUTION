# GDG-SOLUTION
AI Solutions for Smallholder Farmers uses AI,ML, and Satellite Data to help farmers detect pests, monitor crops, and optimize resources. 
📸 Farmers can take a picture of their crops, and AI will analyze it to identify diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies. The app then provides personalized solutions to improve crop health. Additionally, satellite imagery and IoT-based monitoring help track farm conditions, while weather forecasting alerts farmers about climate changes. The app supports offline access to ensure usability in remote areas.

What makes our solution unique? ✅ Affordability – Works on low-cost smartphones. ✅ Ease of use – Simple UI with local language support. ✅ Sustainability – Reduces unnecessary pesticide use and promotes eco-friendly farming. This innovation can significantly boost agricultural productivity, benefiting millions of farmers globally.

Looking ahead, we plan to integrate drone technology for large-scale monitoring, expand the platform to more regions and languages, and collaborate with NGOs and governments to maximize impact. By leveraging AI for agriculture, we aim to create a sustainable, efficient, and technology-driven future for small farmers worldwide. 🌍🚀
